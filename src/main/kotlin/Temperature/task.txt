Weather comparison
Consider a program that reads three numbers representing the temperature in
Dubai, Moscow, and Hanoi and prints the name of the coldest city.
If the input number is less than -92 or greater than 57, the temperature
will be set to the default value, which is the average temperature in the city:
+5 for Moscow, +20 for Hanoi, and +30 for Dubai. If the coldest temperature
occurs in more than one city, the output is "neither".

Your task is to finish the implementation of the City class and comparison in
the main function of this program.
